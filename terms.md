TERMS OF SERVICE
Last Revised: March 25, 2025

The following terms and conditions (the “Terms”) govern all use of the www.cashtags.ai website and any related Cashtags.ai mobile device application (collectively, the “Service”). The Service is operated by Cashtags.ai and its affiliates (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “Cashtags.ai”), a data aggregator providing entertainment through AI-generated summaries of internet stock mentions. In these Terms, “you” or “your” means the person accepting these Terms and the company (if any) on whose behalf they are acting.

By using or accessing the Service, you agree that you are at least eighteen (18) years old, have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms, which form a legally binding agreement between you and Cashtags.ai. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service. If you are entering these Terms on behalf of a company, you represent that you have the authority to bind that company. We may modify these Terms at our discretion, and your continued use after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of those changes. Additional terms may apply to specific products or services and will control if they conflict with these Terms.

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND A DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE. THE SERVICE IS INTENDED FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.

I. Registration Data and Account Security
To use parts of the Service, you may need to register an account with an email address, password, and username (“Registration Data”). You agree to:

(a) provide accurate, current, and complete Registration Data;

(b) maintain the security of your password and username;

(c) update your Registration Data to keep it accurate and current;

II. Access to the Service
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Cashtags.ai grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access and use the Service and its Content for your personal, non-commercial entertainment consistent with your subscription tier. This license does not include any collection, aggregation, copying, duplication, scraping, display, or derivative use of the Service for redistribution or commercial purposes unless expressly permitted by Cashtags.ai in writing. A limited exception is provided to general-purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public archives that gather information solely to display hyperlinks to the Service.

III. Your Responsibilities
Cashtags.ai is a data aggregator that compiles publicly available internet data for your entertainment. You are solely responsible for any decisions or actions you take based on the Service—whether financial, personal, or otherwise—and we do not guide or influence those choices. Enjoy the Service as a fun, informational tool, but know that what you do with it is entirely up to you.

IV. Paid Products or Services
We may offer paid subscriptions for access to premium AI-generated summaries and insights (“Paid Services”) as part of the entertainment experience. If you purchase Paid Services, you agree to pay the applicable fees listed on the Service. Fees may change with notice posted on the Service; temporary promotions or fee reductions require no advance notice.

You must provide a payment method via our third-party payment processor, Stripe. If payment fails or your account is past due, we may charge other methods on file, use collection agencies, or report to credit bureaus. Late fees may apply. Contact support@cashtags.ai to dispute reported information.

V. Payment Policies
Payments are processed through Stripe, subject to its terms and privacy policy (see https://stripe.com/privacy). You agree to pay all charges at the listed prices using your provided payment method. We may correct payment errors even after payment is received.

Subscriptions may be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually (“Subscription Period”), with fees pre-paid at the start of each period. Fee changes take effect at the next Subscription Period. Pre-paid fees are non-refundable except at our discretion or if legally required. Cancel via your account dashboard or by emailing support@cashtags.ai; access continues until the current Subscription Period ends. You are responsible for all taxes related to your use of the Service.

We may cancel your subscription at any time. If cancellation is not due to non-payment or breach of Terms, you’ll receive a pro-rated refund for remaining full months.

We are not responsible for its accuracy or completeness. You use Content at your own risk and may not rely on it as investment advice. Cashtags.ai is not liable for any loss or damage from your use of Content.
