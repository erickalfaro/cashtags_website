This is a Next.js web application, deployed on Vercel, focused on real-time stock market trends and social media insights for investors and traders. It integrates Supabase (database/auth), Stripe (subscriptions), Alpaca/Polygon.io (stock data), and OpenAI (AI summaries). Key features include a real-time ticker tape, stock charts, social media posts, and AI summaries, with a free tier (limited clicks) and premium tier (unlimited access). Built with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, it uses Next.js API routes for serverless logic, Supabase for real-time updates, and Chart.js for visualizations, optimized for Vercelâ€™s serverless environment.
